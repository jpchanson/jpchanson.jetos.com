Jan is an aspiring software developer with exposure to a variety of programming languages including: Java, 
C++, PHP and Python, although most work is currently being done in Java. He has a passion for Object Oriented 
design as well as the use of Design Patterns and is constantly looking to expand his knowledge of the field through 
private study and experimentation.
</p>

<p>
As an avid Linux user he is comfortable using both desktop environments and the command line interface to perform a 
wide range of tasks from coding(eclipse and command line) to setting up and running various types of server 
software(Samba, SSH, VNC, MySQL, etc). It is his preferred operating system and is currently running ArchBang(a variant 
of Arch Linux). He is also proficient using the Microsoft Office software suite.
</p>

<p>
Jan has previously studied Theoretical Physics at Royal Holloway, however, due to the errors of youth he came out with 
a DipHE rather than a bachelors degree in Theoretical physics. This is a lesson he has felt the consequences of and has 
taken very much to heart.
</p>

<p>
After Royal Holloway, he spent the next 8 years working as a Chef in a variety of gastropubs, fine dining restaurants, 
and upmarket hotels. Food has always been a passion (especially pastry and desserts) and allowed Jan to explore his creative 
side: Creating new dishes, improving old ones, beautiful plating. As well as the more practical side: Ordering, menu design, 
costing. Ultimately however the need for intellectual stimulation drove him to apply to Brunel University to study computer science.
