         <h3>Summary</h3>
         <p>
         Designing and implementing an application such as this using the android framework has been challenging and fun, with more than enough areas
         to sink my teeth into over the year. From working out how to implement live camera previews and maps, to polling gps hardware, as well as using
         design patterns to effectively incorporate application and business logic in a loosly coupled and cohesive way. 
         </p>
         <p>Overall the experience I had with this group project was very positive. I learned a great deal: about android, java servlets using
         Jetty, electronic collaboration methods, and about working closely with people to achieve a series of goals. There were low points and 
         high points, as one would expect, but i have come away from it with more than I went in.
         </p>
         <p>
         The group of people I was working closely with this year, have been a hard working, intelligent and considerate bunch, and I would be happy
         If I were to work with them again in the future. I would like to thank: Mark Passey, Emmet Wray, Ian Muigai and Mathuchanth Chandrakumar for
         giving me the opportunity for their hard work and dedication throughout the year.
         </p>
