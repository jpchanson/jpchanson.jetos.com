						This site is written, maintained and hosted by Jan Hanson, its purpose is to provide an online portfolio of development work as well
						as other significant(debatably) aspects of my life, both professional and not. 
					</p>
					<p>
						The Site is hosted on a rather delapidated single-core laptop with a dud battery and 512Mb DDR1 ram in the washing machine cupboard, 
						so apologies for any downtime, lag or other issues this may cause. The system runs an Apache web server as well as some other servers 
						(samba, ssh, MariaDB, etc) not accessible to the public. Thankfully Arch Linux does not require many resources, so at least there's that
					</p>
					<p>
						If you should wish to get in contact with me, please feel free to do so (spam will not be opened or responded to, and you should feel
						ashamed and dirty for sending it in the first place)
					</p>
					<p>
						Please enjoy the site, its not much, but it is my little corner of the internet.
					</p>
					<p>
